# EarlyBird #

_Find a new way to wake up with EarlyBird._

-Application name: Early Bird

-Idea: Create an alarm clock that wakes the user up from sleep more naturally and effectively than a traditional alarm clock.

-Mobile Distribution: Android
#### Early Birds Alarm Clock ####

*	To start the alarm process Early Bird concurrently creates a natural sunrise on the users screen and plays natural sounds. This process begins to play 30 minutes prior to the users desired wake up time. The simulated sunrise turns on and so does a natural song like tune of the user’s choice. Gradually as the 30 minutes winds down to the users chosen wake up time the brightness on the screen (our simulated sunrise) and the natural sounds increase to 100 percent volume and brightness, starting from 10%. 
*	This process allows the user to gradually wake up from the sleep eliminating the groggy feeling and increases the frequency and likelihood that the intended user indeed will wake up.
*	Speaking from personal experience, I am a heavy sleeper and have found that waking up prior to my actual wake up time helps me get through the groggy feeling/stage of when I must wake up. This application will improve this dilemma by allowing the user to wake up without feeling as tired and groggy. 


#### Project Description ####

* 	Early Bird is a reconceptualized alarm clock application for Android. Early Bird’s central functionally is to awaken the user from sleep more naturally than a traditional alarm clock. The Early Bird alarm clock aids everyone from early risers, heavy sleepers and just the regular person trying to wake up on time. This is accomplished by approaching thew problem of waking up from a distinctly different philosophical belief than most alarm clocks.


#### Problem Addressing  ####

* 	Alarm clocks do not effectively wake people up from their sleep. The traditional alarm clock is abrupt, unnatural, and goes against human beings’ natural circadian rhythm. Furthermore, the rushed and unexpected style of the traditional alarm clock is what leads to the grogginess we commonly feel when we first wake up from the first dreaded BEEP. But there is a solution, and it’s an application called Early Bird.


#### Platform ####

*	Android, utilizing a Parallels VM. The Operating System present in the VM will be the latest Mac OS for an ARM64 based processor, not the usual x86 Intel processor. I’m developing on a MacMini.

#### Front/back End Support ####

*	Front end support would be handled by android, the controller will be handled by Django/Python, and the Model will be in some version of SQL, most likely SQLite.


#### Functionality ####
*  Basic functionality is to allow the user to create an account 
   *  Or sign in
*	Make alarms
*	Delete alarms
*	Edit alarms
*	Check alarms existence and ensure its properly setup to the users liking 
*	Each alarm will allow the user to 
    *  Set alarm time
    *  Set sunrise and when it will play prior to the wake up
    *  and set alarm sound
